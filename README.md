### Vanilla Valheim now includes most of the functionality that valheim-plus offered and the mod appears to be unmaintained.

# valheim-plus-installer-linux
A small bash script to install valheim plus on linux

Just clone and run.

Will ask for path if non-standard.

Will make a backup in ~/valheim_backups_4u

TODO: 
* Better docs
* Make valheim plus source url dynamic
* Check signature before download
